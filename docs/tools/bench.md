Benchmarks
==========

The `bench` directory in the Bril repository contains a fledgling suite of microbenchmarks that you can use to measure the impact of your optimizations.
(Benchmarks are different from tests because they are meant to actually calculate something instead of just exercising a language feature.)

The current benchmarks are:

* `adj2csr`: Convert a graph in [adjacency matrix][adj] format (dense representation) to [Compressed Sparse Row (CSR)][csr] format (sparse representation). The random graph is generated using the same [linear congruential generator][rng].
* `adler32`: Computes the [Adler-32 Checksum][adler32] of an integer array.
* `armstrong`: Determines if the input is an [Armstrong number][armstrong], a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
* `binary-fmt`: Print the binary format for the given positive integer.
* `binary-search`: Search a target integer within an integer array, outputs the index of target.
* `birthday`: Simulation of the [birthday][birthday] paradox with an input of `n` people in a given room.

* `catalan`: Print the *n*th term in the [Catalan][catalan] sequence, compute using recursive function calls.
* `check-primes`: Check the first *n* natural numbers for primality, printing out a 1 if the number is prime and a 0 if it's not.
* `cholesky`: Perform Cholesky decomposition of a Hermitian and positive definite matrix. The result is validated by comparing with Python's `scipy.linalg.cholesky`.
* `collatz`: Print the [Collatz][collatz] sequence starting at *n*. Note: it is not known whether this will terminate for all *n*.
