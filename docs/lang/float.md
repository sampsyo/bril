Floating Point
==============

Bril has an extension for computing on floating-point numbers.

You can read [more about the extension][fpblog], which is originally by [Dietrich Geisler][dietrich] and originally included two FP precision levels.

Types
-----

The floating point extension adds one new base type:

    "float"

Floating point numbers are 64-bit, double-precision [IEEE 754][] values.
(There is no single-precision type.)

[IEEE 754]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754

Operations
----------

There are the standard arithmetic operations, which take two `float` values and produce a new `float` value:

- `fadd`
- `fmul`
- `fsub`
- `fdiv`

It is not an error to `fdiv` by zero; as in IEEE 754, the result is infinity.

There are also comparison operators, which take two `float` values and produce a `bool`:

- `feq`
- `flt`
- `fle`
- `fgt`
- `fge`

Printing
--------

The [core `print` operation](./core.md#miscellaneous) prints `float` values with 17 decimal digits of precision, including trailing zeros.
For values with magnitude 10¹⁰, it uses exponential notation with suffixes like `e+12`.
(In terms of C's `printf`, this is like using the `%.17lf` format specifier for small values and `%.17e` for large values, i.e., when `f.abs().log10().abs >= 10`.)

Positive and negative zero, while they are equal according to `feq`, look different when printed.
Not-a-number values are printed as `NaN`; infinite values are printed as the strings `Infinity` or `-Infinity`.
